Task 1
The Google Sheets Clone is a React-based spreadsheet application with core functionalities like cell editing, formulas, drag & copy, data quality functions, CSV export, charts, and Firebase cloud storage. Built using React.js with hooks, it manages state efficiently while maintaining modular UI components (Sheet.js, Toolbar.js, FormulaBar.js, ChartComponent.js). Users can edit cells, input formulas (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A3)`), and apply transformations like TRIM, UPPER, and FIND & REPLACE. The app supports localStorage for persistence and Firebase for cloud saving. Additional features include a color picker for text styling, Chart.js for visualization, and CSV export for data download.



Task 2
The chatbot was built using a Node.js backend with Express.js and a React.js frontend, enabling real-time question answering on Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. Web scraping with Axios and Cheerio fetched relevant content, while NLP techniques (Jaro-Winkler Distance) improved query matching. The API was tested using Postman and cURL. The React frontend featured a floating chat UI, smooth animations, chat history persistence via localStorage, and export options. Deployment was planned via Render/Vercel (backend) and Netlify/Vercel (frontend), with GitHub for version control. Future enhancements include speech-to-text for improved interactivity and accessibility.
