Task 1
The Google Sheets Clone is a React-based spreadsheet application with core functionalities like cell editing, formulas, drag & copy, data quality functions, CSV export, charts, and Firebase cloud storage. Built using React.js with hooks, it manages state efficiently while maintaining modular UI components (Sheet.js, Toolbar.js, FormulaBar.js, ChartComponent.js). Users can edit cells, input formulas (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A3)`), and apply transformations like TRIM, UPPER, and FIND & REPLACE. The app supports localStorage for persistence and Firebase for cloud saving. Additional features include a color picker for text styling, Chart.js for visualization, and CSV export for data download.
